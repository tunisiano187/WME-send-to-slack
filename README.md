## Current Verion of the script ##
Check here : https://wmests.bowlman.org

## What's doing this script ? ##

It's more easy to send requests about Lock, Downlock, Closure, Openning, and Validation of changes
The requests are sent from the WME to a webhook in Slack or Discord or even to a Telegram group chat.
The requests can be sent to a GForm too (currently only with the sames fields we have in BeLux) (Currently broken)
Thanks to that and to Bertzzz's , we've got a spreadsheet that helps to promotion decision on L1-L3 levels.
Thanks to santyg2001, we've added Telegram bot support for sending messages.

## What's New ##
This script now supports States, and i've added the USA NewYork, New Jersay, ...
This script now supports Telegram

## What does it looks like ? ##
 
The Validation link is on top of the Left collumn just above the settings tab

   Just one thing, this part only shows if the closure layer is set
